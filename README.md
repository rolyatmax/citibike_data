CitiBike: An Average Summer Week
===========================

Nearly 1GB of data was collected from the CitiBike API during the summer of 2013 by my colleague Jason Capehart. I crunched the numbers to see what the typical summer week was like for the CitiBike stations.

I'm planning on adding in some more information here about how I built this - but wanted to get this up online as soon as I could.

I used [Sketch.js](https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js) to set up my canvas.
